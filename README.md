# linux_fb_lvgl

Run lvgl under linux using FB driver

## Why

I'm learning how to drive the display device under linux. since fb_tft help me do that for me already, so i am wondering why not implement lvgl on the FB dev

And i am also learning Makefile and clang.

So here it is!

## What should i do if i want to use this

1. First you need to set up FB dev by dts, you can find [instruction](https://flowus.cn/leonard/share/518d1af9-ceb8-47dc-a9a6-15d253fcdd83?code=A5UW2R) here
2. Test your fb dev yourself
3. Change the macro FB_DEV in disp.h
4. Build and run

## How
Refer to previous chapter
